                <h3>Osteopathic Treatment</h3>
                <p>We reactivate the body's self-healing processes by restoring movement and rhythm. Osteopathic
                    treatment can be beneficial in cases of pain and restricted movement throughout the entire body.
                    Common triggers for pain often include blocked joints, visceral dysfunctions, adhered tissues, or
                    tense muscles. In osteopathy, we consider the spine, intervertebral discs, vertebral joints,
                    capsular ligaments, muscles, nerves, organs, and vessels. When the overall structure is healthy, you
                    will also feel well. Through osteopathy, we can discover and treat conditions such as spinal
                    problems, disc herniations, migraines, headaches, dysfunction of internal organs, digestive issues,
                    and much more. By addressing and resolving blockages, osteopathy aims to restore a pleasant sense of
                    well-being.

                <h3>At the practice</h3>
                <p>The treatment is provided by appointment made via phone or contact form. Extended waiting times are
                    not necessary.
                    Please arrive approximately 5 minutes before the scheduled appointment and bring a large towel with
                    you. The number and duration of treatments depend on the patient's condition. A typical treatment
                    lasts about 45 â€“ 60 minutes. On average, 3-5 sessions are needed for classical osteopathic
                    indications, depending on the nature of the complaint and the healing process. For patients with
                    acute issues, short-notice appointments can be arranged. Home visits are possible on a case-by-case
                    basis.

                has different billing modalities, so please inquire with your health insurance provider for specific
