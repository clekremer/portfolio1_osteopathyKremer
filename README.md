## Design

###Imagery
The imagery should give the user an impression of a warm and caring contact by hands. He should get the feeling that he would the get treated by this therapist.

###Colours
The colours should have a clear canon. A colour should not be used only once, it should appear repeatedly. For example the blue form the logo appears again in the menu icon and in the border lines of the website; the grey from the hands background appears again in the footer. The colours were chosen to give the user a clear an straight impression.
